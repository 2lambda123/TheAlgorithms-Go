# Cyclic Linked List
***
## What is it?
***
Loop lists are single or doubly-linked lists that chase their own tail:
A point to B, B point to C, C point to D, and D point to A.
They are better suited for cyclic data such as train schedules.
These lists are missing the first and last items.
Therefore, it is necessary to introduce the concept of the current position.
