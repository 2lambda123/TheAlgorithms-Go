Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical
insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

## Solution Guidelines

Before reading the solution guidelines, make sure you read the whole [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Go/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) as it won't be repeated in here. 

### Coding Style

* Please maintain consistency in project directory and solution file names. Keep the following points in mind:
  * Create a new directory only for the problems which do not exist yet.
  * Please name the project **directory** as `problem_<problem_number>` where `problem_number` should be filled with 0s so as to occupy 3 digits. Example: `problem_001`, `problem_002`, `problem_003`, `problem_100`, and so on.

  * Please name the solution file as `sol_<solution_number>` Example: `sol_1.go`, `sol_2.go`, ...
