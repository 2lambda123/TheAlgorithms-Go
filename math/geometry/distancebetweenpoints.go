// This function calculates the distance based on Cartesian Plane Distance Formula
// Formula: âˆš((x1-x2) * (x1-x2) + (y1-y2) * (y1-y2))
// Takes x and y coordinates of two point
// Returns distnce in floating number

	// Find difference between x-coordinates
	xDiff := x2 - x1

	// Find difference between y-coordinates
	yDiff := y2 - y1

	// Apply formula
	distance := (xDiff * xDiff) + (yDiff * yDiff)

	// Return square root
	return math.Sqrt(distance)
